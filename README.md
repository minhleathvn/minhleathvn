# Hi there, I'm Ngoc Minh LE! 👋

I'm a software engineer at Unified, part of iHeartMedia, where I work with data to create meaningful and impactful solutions. My journey in software engineering has taken me through exciting challenges in Adtech, building data pipelines, and leveraging cloud technologies to solve real-world problems.

## 👨‍💻 What I Do
- **Tech Stack**: I mainly work with Python, Dask, and AWS Glue, but I’m always exploring new technologies to broaden my skills.
- **Current Focus**: I'm currently focusing on optimizing ETL processes, transforming big datasets, and improving the scalability of our data systems.
- **Learning Goals**: Right now, I'm interested in diving deeper into distributed systems and improving my skills in cloud infrastructure. I aim to become an ML/AI Engineer within the next two years.

## 🚀 What I’m Interested In
- **Data Engineering**: I love working with data, making sense of it, and ensuring it flows seamlessly through systems.
- **Technical Growth**: My current focus is on deepening my technical expertise—management isn’t my main priority at the moment, as I enjoy solving technical challenges hands-on.

## 🌱 A Bit More About Me
- **Adtech Specialist**: Most of my experience is in Adtech, building systems that drive insights and performance.
- **Curious Learner**: I believe in continuous learning and experimentation—whether it’s working on new side projects, exploring emerging technologies, or learning from my amazing colleagues.
- **Beyond Work**: I'm also a parent, with one child in kindergarten and another in third grade, so balancing work and family life is a big part of my journey.

Feel free to reach out or explore my repos! I'm always happy to collaborate, learn, or share insights. 😊
